        <b>Professor Mohammad Aazam:</b>
        Hello, I'm Professor Mohammad Aazam, and I teach the Information Systems Consulting
        Project course at Carnegie Mellon University’s Qatar Campus. While my colleague Professor
        Joseph Mertz leads the course in the Pittsburgh Campus, he also serves as the Program
        Director for the Information Systems program across both our Qatar and Pittsburgh campuses.
        What is a community partner? A community partner is an organization that collaborates with our
        student teams to solve real-world information system challenges. These partners range from
        nonprofits and government entities to startups and private businesses. Our goal is to create
        impactful solutions that not only benefit our partners but also provide our students with
        invaluable real-world experience.
        Anyone passionate about making a positive impact and facing an information system challenge
        can join us as a community partner. We're particularly interested in organizations aiming to
        bridge the digital divide, supporting underprivileged communities, and looking to enhance their
        technological capabilities.
        <br><br>
        <b>Professor Julia Poepping:</b>
        Hello, I'm Julia Poepping, Associate Director of Partnership Development at Carnegie Mellon
        University's Pittsburgh Campus. I work hand in hand with Lubna Barghouti, the Director of

        technological expertise, and fresh perspectives. This partnership is an opportunity to tackle your
        most pressing problems while contributing to the education and growth of our students.
        Becoming a community partner means you'll engage actively with our student teams, providing
        them with real-world problems to solve. There is no fee to participate, but your commitment is
        key. You'll need to meet regularly with your team, provide feedback, and share your expertise. In
        return, you'll receive innovative solutions and improvements, all tailored to your organization's
        needs.
        Joining us is easy: fill out the application form on our website, and we’ll guide you through the
        rest. Our program has a remarkable success and return rate, with 35% of our partners coming

        fostering meaningful partnerships. Don't miss this unique opportunity to transform and grow
